## Overview
From [month] to [month] 2013 Development Gateway, the Government of Nepal, and the Open Aid Partnership worked on a small pilot on open procurement. Unlike other open procurement initiatives, the goal wasn't specifically related to procurement processes themselves (e.g. focusing on transparency, anti-corruption, etc.), but rather the goal was to begin to understand how open procurement processes might be able to produce operationally-relevant data which could, as a by-product, help with the more general planning and coordination of international development projects. 

With proper analysis, we believe that the results of this pilot can yield relevant insights for the open contracting movement more broadly. As a first step towards that we have forked the data visualization approach from http://birdsarah.github.io/oc-datamerge-spike/ and used it to present the data model used during our pilot, as well as provide a comparison between our pilot's data model and the draft data model put forward for discussion by the Open Contracting group.
